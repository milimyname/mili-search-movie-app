## My process

### Built with

- React Native
- React Native Navigation
- Redux

### What I learned

Tbh I've only used React Native for an understanding what it is and now I've created my first app. I was excited and worried about the fact I couldn't manage to do it. The design doesn't look like a real world project but I'll do it better.
